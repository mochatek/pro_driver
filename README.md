# Pro Driver

- Simple 2D bottom-down game built using [python-arcade](https://arcade.academy/)
- Level/Map created using [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
- You are riding a car through a heavy traffic highway.Can you ride safe?
- Cars will be passing through both sides. As the pro driver, you must avoid hitting other cars.
- When any cars collide, they will move and rotate with respect to their speed,possibly hitting other cars around.
- This can create a chain reaction of deadly burning cars. Once they hit you, you are done. "Game Over"
- Don't be afraid, you are the 'Pro Driver' riht? Ride safe as long as possible. :car:
